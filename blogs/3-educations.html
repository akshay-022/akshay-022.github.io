    const markdown = `# My 3 Educations

Dec 12, 2024

I have been building in the AI for education space for several months now and have spent many brain cycles thinking about it.

I want to break down my thoughts into three parts:

1. My 3 educations,
2. the RoI on education, before and after AGI,
3. the ideal education I would have liked (and what I'm building AI for),

---

## **Part 1: The three educations I went through**

I realise I have gone through 3 very different educations.

I want to set some context first. I studied in the school ranked the best in India when I was in high school, and did my undergrad at IIT Bombay (The best tech university in India).

I also took supplementary classes for physics and math, of grades 2-3 years above my own, with a small group of smart kids in my city.

My education was likely the best education anyone in India could hope for.

### **Education 1: School and university (the traditional path)**

School was boring and mostly useless.

Subjects like history, geography and literature were majorly memorization. I had to memorize the names of 25 rivers and their exact paths in India, and the metaphors Shakespeare made verbatim in all his characters' speeches. These were useless details.

Parts of history, geography and literature are very important but not the ones my school emphasised.

Math and Physics went awfully slow for me. I usually read my own books in class.

University was the same - I had to memorize low-level technical details of a MOSFET, and the exact step by step derivation of a variational autoencoder, both unnecessary.

Safe to say that ~95% of classroom time was wasted.

However this education had one huge upside -  it made me socially adept. It taught me confidence, charisma and how to make friends.

---

### **Education 2: Supplementary STEM coaching**

My second education came from my supplementary STEM classes - preparation for the IIT-JEE exam that most young Indian students give to get into the IIT universities.

This was my best classroom education - the class was very small (just 9 students), we went fast in class, and I asked many questions. It was the closest I have been to a personal tutor.

The speed of the class content kept me engaged.

I also thoroughly enjoyed learning physics - it felt like I was understanding the universe better.

Math and Chemistry felt good because I was making progress in my IIT-JEE prep.

---

### **Education 3: Self-directed learning through reading**

The third education was entirely self-driven.

I read only what I found interesting and what I believed would help me change the world. Through books, I learned about relationships, economics, AI, founders and their mistakes, critical thinking, cosmology, philosophy, and sales.

This has been, by far, the highest-ROI education of my life. It compounded. It changed how I think. It has shaped who I am.

The downsides were that many books were unnecessarily long, left several incomplete or untouched. Secondly, it was quite haphazard - most were twitter/youtube recommendations I stumbled upon.

Most people find it difficult to find the time or create the systems to self-educate consistently.

**Again I want to emphasise**, the education I mentioned above is one that less than 0.1% of students in India receive. Even if all students in India received the 3 educations I mentioned above, the impact would fundamentally reshape India's trajectory. It would be one of the largest unhobblings of human capital the world has ever seen.

## **Part 2: the ROI on education pre and post-AGI**

## Pre-AGI

### **1. Education compounds, even at the extreme tail**

The people who dominate outcomes over decades are almost always obsessive learners. This includes the CEOs of almost every major company in the world - Elon, Charlie, Buffett, Bezos, Jensen. Several directly attribute their success to this.

### **2. In the path to AGI**

Even if AGI renders everyone useless, the path to AGI will entail many very important decisions. Smarter humans means better policy, better decisions, more people solving problems before they become big. It may help us get to the AI utopia more than most other things.

## Post-AGI

### **1. AGI makes loss of human agency the default outcome**

In a world of superintelligence, it becomes extremely easy to stop thinking. Most people will drift into passive AI consumption - watching AI slop.

Education is likely the only real counterweight to miaintain agency and autonomy.

### **2. When humans merge with AI**

Even if humans "merge" with AI, it will not be a native extension of our cognition. It will look more like asking ChatGPT questions faster and receiving answers faster.

Even IF AI gives us all the answers very quickly, the bottleneck remains human. It's the same analogy as why the calculator didn't make everyone as smart as Von Neumann or why google did not make everyone a super genius immediately. We need to know what to ask.

So hopefully we have established that this is something worth fixing.

---

## **Part 3: The ideal education I would have liked**

What is the ideal education then? There are two core elements my education was missing.

### **1. A breadth-first understanding of the world**

I wanted exposure to a wide range of fields - and, more importantly, an understanding of their *boundaries*.

I was forced to memorize details that had no leverage.

All I really needed was a map of what's possible - so I could decide what I actually wanted to work on. And then I dive deeper on a need to know basis. Depth should come *after* direction, not before.

This is the kind of interdisciplinary education Charlie Munger and Naval talk about.

### **2. Real work, much earlier**

I would have liked to start working on real projects much sooner - things I cared deeply about, poured energy into, and put out into the world.

I visited Alphaschool (A new age school in SF that's getting all the buzz) and saw what this looks like in practice. One high school student built a TikTok musical that reached 30M views and now performs it live in NYC and Chicago. Another built an AI therapist embedded in soft toys. These projects teach far more than exams ever could. This kind of education builds agency.

I'm building an AI tutor that gives this breadth-first, interdisciplinary, project-oriented education. If it works - because it's software - it could scale to every human unlike any school or university before.

I've already launched and tested two products in stealth, both aimed at adults.

Now I'm focused on middle and high school students - people whose full-time job is to learn, and who still have the time and flexibility to shape how they think.

I'm looking for collaborators. If you read this and feel an unusually strong pull toward it, please reach out at akshaygiyer@gmail.com.`;
